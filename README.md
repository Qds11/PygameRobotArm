#Robot Arm Simulation

This Python program simulates a robot arm using the Pygame library. The arm consists of multiple segments, and you can control the rotation of each segment using the keyboard. A pincher is attached at the end of the arm, and you can open and close it.

##How to Run

###Prerequisites: You need to have Python and Pygame installed on your system.

###Running the Program: To run the program, execute the Python script in your terminal or preferred Python development environment. Ensure that you are in the correct directory.


##Controlling the Robot Arm:

Use the LEFT arrow key to rotate the upper arm.
Use the RIGHT arrow key to rotate the upper arm.
Press the SPACE key to open and close the pincher.
Visualization: The program creates a window using Pygame and displays the robot arm. You can see the robot arm segments, and the pincher attached to the end. The arm's joints are represented by red circles.

##Program Structure

The program defines a class myPolygon that represents individual segments of the robot arm. Each segment has attributes like position, rotation angle, and color.
The program uses transformation matrices to control the position and rotation of arm segments and the pincher.
